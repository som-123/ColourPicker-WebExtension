# ColourPicker-WebExtension

Aim:
The aim of this project is to develop a web browser extension called "Colour Picker" that allows users to easily identify and capture colours from web pages. The project aims to provide a simple and convenient way for users to extract colour values and use them in various design and development tasks.

Eye Dropper Tool:
The WebExtension will include an eye dropper tool, which users can activate to obtain the color of any element on a web page. This tool will enable users to select colors from images, backgrounds, buttons, or any other visual component within the browser viewport.

Color Code Format:
The WebExtension will support color code format of hexadecimal (e.g., #FF0000).

Implementation:
The Colour Picker WebExtension will be developed using web technologies such as HTML, CSS, and JavaScript, leveraging the browser's extension framework (e.g., Chrome Extension API or Mozilla WebExtensions API). The project will utilize the DOM (Document Object Model) to retrieve color information from web pages. 

Conclusion:
The aim of the "Colour Picker" web extension project is to develop a user-friendly tool that simplifies colour identification, management, and manipulation within web pages. By providing efficient colour selection, palette generation, and export capabilities, the extension aims to enhance users' productivity, streamline design workflows, and facilitate seamless integration of colour values into various design and development tasks.
